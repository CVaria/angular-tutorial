  /*
  EventEmitter is an angular abstraction and its only purpose is to emit events in components.
  @Input() and @Output() allow Angular to share data between the parent context and child directives. 
  An @Input() property is writable while an @Output() property is observable.
  Think of @Input() and @Output() like ports or doorwaysâ€”@Input() is the doorway into the component allowing data to flow in while @Output() is the doorway out of the component, allowing the child component to send data out.
