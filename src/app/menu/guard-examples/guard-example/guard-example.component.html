<!--
Guards in Angular allow to grant or remove access to certain parts of the navigation. 
In addition, there is the CanDeactivate guard which allows us to prevent a user from accidentally leaving a component with unsaved changes.

There are 4 types of routing guards available:

    - CanActivate: Controls if a route can be activated.
    - CanActivateChild: Controls if children of a route can be activated.
    - CanLoad: Controls if a route can even be loaded (used for lazy loaded modules: if the guard returns false, they will not load).
    - CanDeactivate: Controls if the user can leave a route. Note that this guard doesnâ€™t prevent the user from closing the browser tab or navigating to a different address. It only prevents actions from within the application itself.
-->

<h3>Example of CanActivate Guard:</h3>
<div>
<h4>Set password to gain access: </h4>
<input type = "text" [(ngModel)]="password"/>
<button (click)="checkPassword()">Go to Secret Page</button>
<br> 
</div>
